# Changelog

All notable changes to UnraidMonitor will be documented in this file.

## [0.9.1] - 2026-03-03

### Security
- **Pinned Docker base image** - `python:3.11-slim` now uses SHA256 digest to prevent supply chain attacks
- **Fixed overly permissive umask** - Changed from `0000` to `0022` in entrypoint.sh so created files are no longer world-writable
- **Moved AI SDKs to optional deps** - `anthropic` and `openai` are now optional dependencies under `[ai]` extra, reducing attack surface for non-AI deployments
- **Escape Markdown in container names** - All alert and command messages now use `escape_markdown()` for container names, preventing Telegram formatting injection from specially-crafted names
- **Callback data truncation** - `truncate_callback_data()` enforces Telegram's 64-byte limit on inline button callback data, preventing silent failures with long container names

### Fixed
- **Multi-user alert delivery** - Alerts are now sent to all authorized users instead of only the most recently active one. Affects server alerts, memory alerts, restart prompts, startup notifications, and wizard completion messages
- **Thread-safe RateLimiter** - Added `threading.Lock` to prevent race conditions between Docker event thread and async loop
- **Thread-safe IgnoreManager reads** - `get_all_ignores()`, `get_runtime_ignores()`, and `get_containers_with_runtime_ignores()` now hold the lock during reads; `defer_save` flag set under lock
- **Dirty flag on mute expiry** - `BaseMuteManager` now sets `_dirty = True` when cleaning expired mutes, ensuring the change is persisted
- **Memory threshold validation** - `MemoryConfig.from_dict()` validates that critical > warning > safe thresholds and falls back to defaults if misordered
- **Polling interval clamping** - Unraid system poll minimum 10s, array poll minimum 30s; prevents tight loops from misconfiguration
- **DEFAULT_LOG_WATCHING mutation** - Fixed shared mutable default dict being modified at runtime; now copies before use
- **Manage dashboard uses safe\_edit** - All manage sub-view callbacks now use `safe_edit()` instead of raw `answer()`, preventing Markdown parse failures
- **Unraid connectivity verification** - `UnraidClientWrapper.connect()` now verifies the server is reachable before setting `_connected = True`
- **Server alert formatting** - Server alerts now use `parse_mode="Markdown"` with `escape_markdown()` consistently
- **Dynamic cooldown text** - Error alerts show the configured cooldown duration instead of hardcoded "15 minutes"
- **Removed "Brisbooks" from defaults** - Removed author-specific container from default watched list

### Changed
- **Duration parser supports days** - Mute duration parser now accepts `"d"` suffix (e.g., `3d` for 3 days) in addition to `"m"` and `"h"`
- **PatternAnalyzer cache bounded** - LRU-style eviction at 256 entries prevents unbounded memory growth
- **NLProcessor user locks cleanup** - Stale (unlocked) entries pruned when dict exceeds 100 entries
- **Split SystemMonitor cache timestamps** - Each metric type (cpu, memory, temp) has its own cache timestamp for independent refresh
- **OpenAI/Ollama env vars in docker-compose** - Added `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `OLLAMA_HOST` to docker-compose.yml environment

### Removed
- Dead UPS mute methods (`mute_ups`, `unmute_ups`, `is_ups_muted`) from `ServerMuteManager` — no UPS monitoring exists

### Added
- `escape_markdown()` utility in formatting.py for safe Telegram message content
- `truncate_callback_data()` utility for safe inline button callback data
- 132 new tests: `test_formatting_utils.py` (53), `test_per_user_rate_limiter.py` (10), expanded `test_sanitize.py` (14 new), expanded `test_unraid_client.py` and `test_unraid_system_monitor.py`
- Total test count: 1020 (up from 888)

## [0.9.0] - 2026-02-25

### Added
- **Container recovery notifications** - When a previously crashed container starts successfully, the bot sends a brief "✅ recovered" alert. Includes 5-minute cooldown to prevent spam and automatically clears crash history on recovery
- **`/help` section buttons** - Help is now organized into 4 navigable categories (Containers, Server, Alerts, Setup) with inline keyboard buttons instead of a wall of text
- **Typing indicators** - Long operations (diagnose, resources, Unraid commands, control actions) show "typing..." in chat while processing
- **`safe_reply` / `safe_edit` helpers** - Centralized Markdown-safe messaging with automatic `TelegramBadRequest` fallback to plain text, used across all command handlers
- **`format_mute_expiry` helper** - Mute expiry times now show contextual dates: "until 14:30" (same day), "until tomorrow 14:30", or "until Feb 26 14:30" (further out)
- **Back button in `/manage` sub-views** - All manage sub-views (ignores, mutes, ignore details) now include a ⬅️ Back button to return to the dashboard

### Changed
- **Control confirmations use inline buttons** - `/restart`, `/stop`, `/start`, `/pull` now show ✅ Confirm / ❌ Cancel buttons instead of requiring a text "yes" reply. Removed `ConfirmationManager` and `YesFilter`
- **Diagnose "More Details" is a button** - After a `/diagnose` brief, users click a 📋 More Details button instead of typing "more details". Also shows Restart and Logs quick-action buttons. Removed `DetailsFilter`
- **Diagnose matches all alert types** - Replying `/diagnose` to an alert now works for CRASHED, ERRORS IN, and RESTART LOOP alerts (previously only matched CRASHED)
- **Ignore selection uses toggle buttons** - `/ignore` now shows ☐/☑ toggle buttons per error with Select All, Done, and Cancel instead of numbered text selection
- **Manage remove uses delete buttons** - `/manage` → Ignores and Mutes views show per-item 🗑 delete buttons instead of numbered text input
- **Styled usage messages** - `/restart`, `/stop`, `/start`, `/pull`, and `/logs` usage hints now use code formatting and show partial name examples

### Removed
- `src/bot/confirmation.py` - Replaced by inline button confirmation in control_commands.py
- `YesFilter`, `DetailsFilter`, `IgnoreSelectionFilter`, `ManageSelectionFilter` classes - All replaced by callback query handlers
- `tests/test_yes_handler.py`, `tests/test_details_handler.py`, `tests/test_confirmation.py` - Tests for removed components

## [0.8.3] - 2026-02-17

### Fixed
- **Memory restart prompt spam** - After killing a container for memory pressure, the "Restart X?" prompt was sent every 10 seconds instead of once, flooding the chat with duplicate messages
- **Memory restart buttons missing** - The restart prompt was plain text with no interactive buttons, so users couldn't actually accept or decline the restart. Added Yes/No inline keyboard buttons that properly confirm or decline the restart

## [0.8.2] - 2026-02-12

### Fixed
- **Self-monitoring loop** - Bot no longer alerts on its own internal Python log output when watching its own container, preventing feedback loops where errors trigger alerts about those same errors
- **Pattern analyzer noise** - JSON parse failures from Haiku responses now log at WARNING instead of ERROR, since they are model output quality issues, not system errors

## [0.8.1] - 2026-02-10

### Added
- **Restart loop detection** - Detects containers crashing 5+ times in 10 minutes and sends escalated alerts with crash count, separate from normal rate-limited crash alerts
- **`/health` command** - Shows bot version, uptime, all monitor statuses (running/stopped/disabled), Unraid connection state, and recent crash activity
- **Startup notification** - Bot sends a message on startup with container count, watched count, and Unraid status

### Fixed
- **Concurrent NL requests** - Per-user `asyncio.Lock` prevents interleaved Claude API calls from corrupting conversation memory
- **`signal.SIGALRM` crash on non-main thread** - Regex timeout for ignore patterns now uses daemon thread + `join(timeout)` instead of signals
- **Image pull hangs forever** - `pull_and_recreate()` now has a 5-minute timeout on Docker image pulls
- **Docker `load_initial_state()` blocking event loop** - Wrapped in `asyncio.to_thread()` on startup
- **Stale rate limiter entries** - `cleanup_stale()` called at start of each resource monitor poll cycle
- **Container names breaking Markdown** - Escaped underscores/special chars in `/status` and `/logs` multi-match responses
- **YAML parse errors crash startup** - `load_yaml_config()` catches `yaml.YAMLError` and raises descriptive `ValueError`
- **Unraid connection failure silent** - Now sends Telegram notification when Unraid connection fails on startup
- **`os.execv` restart leaking polling** - `dp.stop_polling()` called before exec in wizard completion
- **Concurrent wizard sessions corrupt state** - Only one user can run the setup wizard at a time
- **SSL verification disabled insecurely** - Replaced `ssl=False` with proper `SSLContext` in wizard connection test
- **Double signal handler shutdown** - Guard prevents re-entrant `_graceful_shutdown()` calls
- **Pattern cache XOR collision** - Changed cache key from `id() ^ id()` to tuple `(id(), id())`
- **`call_soon_threadsafe` crash during shutdown** - Wrapped with `RuntimeError` catch in log watcher threads
- **`from_user` None crash in ignore handlers** - Early return guard for channel/anonymous messages
- **Fire-and-forget startup task** - Background monitor task now tracked for graceful shutdown
- **Log watcher unbounded queue** - Added `maxsize=10000` with safe-put that drops on overflow (log storm protection)
- **Config `None` for empty YAML lists** - `ignored_containers` and `protected_containers` default to `[]` instead of `None`
- **Atomic config writes** - `save_yaml_config()` uses `tempfile` + `os.replace()` to prevent corruption on crash

## [0.8.0] - 2026-02-10

### Added
- **Telegram-based setup wizard** - On first run (no config.yaml), an interactive wizard guides users through setup via Telegram chat instead of generating a silent default config
- **Container auto-classification** - Pattern matching identifies ~30 common container types (databases, media servers, download clients, etc.) and assigns them to categories (priority, protected, watched, killable, ignored)
- **AI-assisted classification** - Unknown containers are classified by Claude Haiku when an Anthropic API key is available, with AI suggestions marked in the summary
- **Unraid connection testing** - Wizard auto-detects HTTPS/HTTP and port for the Unraid server
- **`/setup` command** - Re-run the setup wizard at any time; merges non-destructively with existing config (preserves thresholds, custom settings, and Unraid connection details)
- **`/cancel` command** - Exit the setup wizard mid-flow
- **Category descriptions** - Each adjust button in the wizard shows a description explaining what the category is for
- **Auto-restart after wizard** - Bot automatically restarts via `os.execv` after setup completes (works regardless of Docker restart policy)
- **Smart re-run behaviour** - `/setup` re-run tests existing Unraid connection and skips the IP prompt if it works; preserves existing container categories from config instead of re-classifying
- `ContainerClassifier` service with pattern rules and batch AI classification
- `ConfigWriter` with `write()` and `merge()` methods for config.yaml management
- `SetupModeMiddleware` blocks non-wizard commands during setup
- 78 new tests across 4 test files

### Fixed
- **ImageNotFound crash on startup** - Containers referencing removed Docker images (common after updates) caused crashes in event monitor, diagnostic service, container control, and wizard container listing
- **Wizard connection test failures** - Added required `apollo-require-preflight` CSRF header, valid GraphQL query with leaf fields, and logging for connection test diagnostics
- **`/setup` re-run overwrote Unraid settings** - Connection test tried HTTPS:443 first and overwrote working HTTP:80 config; now preserves existing connection settings when they work

### Changed
- **`main.py` refactored** - Extracted `start_monitoring()` function and `_BackgroundTasks` class for cleaner startup; first-run path defers all monitoring until wizard completes
- Removed `generate_default_config()` call from startup (wizard replaces it)

## [0.7.4] - 2026-02-10

### Changed
- **PUID/PGID entrypoint for Unraid permissions** - Container now starts as root and uses an entrypoint script to fix ownership of bind-mounted `/app/config` and `/app/data` directories to `PUID:PGID` (defaults to `99:100` = `nobody:users`), then drops privileges via `gosu`. Fixes root-owned appdata folders created by Community Apps on first install.
- **Permissive file creation** - Set `umask 0000` in entrypoint and added `os.fchmod(fd, 0o666)` to mute/ignore JSON writers so all created files (config.yaml, mute/ignore JSON) are `rw-rw-rw-` instead of owner-only

### Added
- `entrypoint.sh` - Privilege-drop entrypoint that sets directory ownership and runs as non-root user
- `PUID` and `PGID` environment variables (default `99`/`100`) for configurable file ownership
- `gosu` package in Docker image for secure privilege dropping

## [0.7.3] - 2026-02-06

### Security
- **Auth middleware on callback queries** - Authentication was only applied to message handlers, not inline button callbacks. Any user with a forwarded alert could invoke actions. Now enforced on all callback queries (P0-4)
- **Protected container bypass via callbacks** - NL confirm callback and alert restart button bypassed the protected container list. Added `is_protected()` checks (P0-2, P0-3)
- **Sanitized error messages** - Raw exception details from Docker SDK no longer leak to Telegram users (P1-6)
- **ReDoS prevention** - Added signal-based regex timeout for AI-generated ignore patterns (P1-14)
- **Docker socket security** - Documented root-equivalent access risk, added `docker-socket-proxy` recommendation (P1-19)

### Fixed
- **`pull_and_recreate()` redesigned with rollback** - Previously deleted the container before recreation with no recovery path and only extracted 5 config properties. Now preserves 30+ properties and rolls back on failure (P0-1)
- **Wrong method calls in manage dashboard** - `unmute()` → `unmute_array()` and `remove_mute("server")` → `unmute_server()` fixed, preventing partial unmutes and runtime crashes (P0-5, P0-8)
- **NL tool array status schema mismatch** - Was checking wrong field names (`status == "healthy"`, `used_bytes`), now matches actual GraphQL schema (`DISK_OK`, `capacity.kilobytes`) (P0-6)
- **CPU temperature always returned 0** - Changed from hardcoded `0` to `None` when unavailable, with graceful handling in display and alert code (P0-7)
- **Async Anthropic client** - All three Claude API callers switched from synchronous to async, no longer blocking the event loop for 2-30 seconds per call (P1-1)
- **Async Docker SDK calls** - Blocking Docker calls wrapped in `asyncio.to_thread()` across 4 files (P1-2)
- **Parallel Docker stats collection** - `get_all_stats()` now uses `asyncio.gather()` instead of sequential calls, reducing poll time from 20-40s to ~2s for 20 containers (P1-3)
- **Thread-unsafe asyncio.Queue** - Fixed with `call_soon_threadsafe()` in log watcher and docker events (P1-4)
- **Default config uses HTTPS** - Changed default Unraid connection from HTTP port 80 to HTTPS port 443 (P1-5)
- **Alert queuing before chat ID** - Alerts during startup are now queued and flushed when first user sends `/start` (P1-7)
- **Null safety for `from_user` and `callback.message`** - Added None guards preventing AttributeError in channel posts (P1-8, P1-9)
- **Unraid system monitor rate limiting** - No longer sends duplicate alerts every 30-second poll cycle (P1-10)
- **Cancellable log watcher threads** - Stream close mechanism prevents orphaned threads on container restarts (P1-11)
- **Async locking for mute/ignore managers** - Added `asyncio.Lock` to prevent race conditions (P1-12)
- **Unraid client HTTP timeout** - Set 10-second timeout, preventing 5-minute stalls on unresponsive server (P1-13)
- **Hardcoded IP removed** - Replaced `192.168.0.190` with `your-unraid-ip` placeholder in config template (P1-15)
- **Running containers filter** - `containers.list()` now filters by status instead of fetching all (P1-18)
- **Memory leak fixes** - TTL-based cleanup for rate_limiter, diagnostic pending dict, confirmation manager, ignore/manage selection states (P2-10 through P2-13)
- **Threading/task bugs** - Removed threading.Lock from async memory_monitor, fixed double task creation in system_monitor, added ghost container cleanup on reconnect (P2-14 through P2-16)
- **Telegram callback data overflow** - UTF-8 byte-length calculation for callback_data, colon-safe splitting, markdown escaping for container names (P2-17, P2-18, P2-26)
- **Log truncation** - Now accounts for header/footer length to stay within Telegram's 4096 char limit (P2-27)

### Changed
- **Dependencies fully declared** - Added all missing runtime deps (aiogram, pyyaml, pydantic, anthropic, psutil, aiohttp, python-dotenv) to pyproject.toml with pinned upper bounds (P1-16, P1-17, P2-19, P2-25)
- **Dockerfile base image** - Added digest pinning comment (P2-20)
- **Config template** - Added `panic` and `traceback` to default error_patterns (P2-22)
- **`unraid-api` version constraint** - Updated from `>=0.1.0,<1.0.0` to `>=1.0.0,<2.0.0` to match available releases

### Removed
- Dead code: unused imports (`asdict`, `Bot`), dead functions (`cancel`, `is_action_tool`, `is_read_only_tool`, `get_vms`, `get_ups_status`), unused variables, empty `__init__` re-exports (P3-1 through P3-9)
- Orphan UPS config fields with no UPS monitor (P3-12 through P3-14)
- Duplicate `format_uptime` and `extract_container_from_alert` implementations, consolidated into shared utils (P3-10, P3-11)

### Added
- 71 new tests covering ContainerController, DockerEventMonitor, AlertManagerProxy, control commands, NLProcessor, MemoryStore, LogWatcher, ConfirmationManager, AlertManager (P2-1 through P2-9)
- Comprehensive codebase audit report (`docs/audit-report-2026-02-06.md`)
- Shared `utils/formatting.py` module for consolidated utility functions

## [0.7.2] - 2026-02-01

### Fixed
- **Missing resource_monitoring in default config** - The auto-generated config.yaml was missing the resource_monitoring section, causing new deployments to use hardcoded defaults instead of configurable values.

### Added
- `.dockerignore` file to exclude config, tests, and dev files from Docker images
- Tests for default config generation (4 new tests verifying YAML validity and section loading)

### Security
- Added `config/config.yaml` to `.gitignore` to prevent accidental commit of user configurations

## [0.7.1] - 2026-02-01

### Fixed
